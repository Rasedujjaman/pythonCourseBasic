# This python code is interpreted with python 3.7.0

# In this python code we will show how to display different variable types

### Important note: In python the variables are dynamic type meaning 
### it is not necessary to declear the vairalbe type like in C++


your_name = "Karim" # it is a stirng variable
your_age = 30   # it is an integer type variable
your_cgpa = 3.5 # it is a float type variable
your_grade = 'B' # it is also a string type

# The equivalent variable in C++ is declared as follows 
#  string your_name = "Karrim";
#  int your_age = 30;


print(type(your_name))
print(type(your_age))
print(type(your_cgpa))
print(type(your_grade))


### Note: From the above output we see that, In python everyting is considered as object

### <class, 'int'>
### < class, 'str'>
### <class, 'float'>
### <class, 'str'>
