# Here we will discuss the Tuples

# Tuples are similar to list. Unlike lists, tuples are enclosed within parenthesis

# Anothre important point about Tuples is, it is non modifiable

my_tuple = ('abck', 333, 43.22, 'john')
my_tuple2 = (234, 2 + 3j)

print(my_tuple)

# try to change element
# my_tuple[0] = 5260 # assignment not possible

# print(my_tuple) 

print(my_tuple[2:])

print(my_tuple + my_tuple2)
